       "  'reviewText': '.When in the military,  I was stationed in Europe for several years.  The friends I made had a quiz they liked to use: \"What do you call a person who speaks three languages? Trilingual;  What do you call a person who speaks two languages?  Bilingual; What do you call a person who speaks one language?  American.I have wanted to improve my language status for many years.  My High School Latin teacher said that after I learned Latin, the other romance languages would be easy.  I considered the other romance languages (Spanish, Portugese, Italian. Aragonese, Aromanian, Arpitan, Asturian, Corsican, Emiliano-Romagnolo, Friulan, Galician, Ladino, Leonese, Lombard, Mirandese, Neapolitan, Occitan, Piedmontese, Romansh, Sardinian, Sicilian, Venetian and Walloon), only the major four (French, Spanish, Italian, and Portugese were attractive to me, but then I saw this offer from Rosetta Stone and I chose French.Learning French was easier than I thought.  Of course the grammar I learned in my four years studying Latin made French grammar easier.  Well, and I did get a French grammar text and a French dictionary, since Rosetta Level 1 is limited in grammar.  After a few months using the interactive program, I began to feel comfortable speaking the language.I was tempted to brag to my family that I now speak French, then I realized that I had yet to converse in French with another human.  Soon I remembered my years living in Germany.  I had studied German, but could not really have a meaningful conversation with a German.  When I said something in German, they would answer in English (somehow they knew I was an American).  Those who did not speak English (maybe one percent of those I encountered) used a different dialect, and I was back to using my German book and pointing to words.  The lesson for me is that now I must spend some time in France if I really want to learn the language.  Oh well, I can read French as long as people do not get technical.Recently I thought of a possible answer to the dilemma I have with my European friends.  I could learn to speak Walloon, Friulan, and Arpitan.  I am unlikely to encounter anyone who speaks those languages, so no one to question whether I really know it.  Then I will tell them I am \"quadri lingual.\".  Do you think that will work? . . . Neither do I.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Never having studied Italian before, and never having used Rosetta Stone before, I was definitely excited to give it a go and find out what all the hype was about.I went through the whole lesson over the course of a couple of months, spending only about a day or two a week on it.In the end, I think it was a smart system, one that has specific advantages, but also marked disadvantages.POSITIVES:+++ IMMERSION TECHNIQUE -there is no English.  you will only see pictures and hear Italian.  This means you\\'ll learn more effectively, as your brain is forced to make certain connections on its own.  Additionally, when you see pictures, for example, of a \"male\", the picture will be different each time: one time might be a young boy, and then it might be an old man, then a young man, and so on... and the first time you see the picture you might think it is a boy, but when the second picture pops up you realize that the word must mean something else, and you relate the two, and pick the commonality.  Anyway, this is a hard example, and it is simpler than this, but the idea is that you see different pictures representing each word, each time.++ WELL DESIGNED/VARIED -there are multiple modules which are scattered throughout -listening & comprehension, reading, pronunciation, typing, and so on.  It is impressive.++ GOOD REVIEWS -when I finished a section I was happy to find out that many of the concepts came back --not right away, but later when they weren\\'t the freshest in my mind-- this meant I had to remember it, and basically memorized it through this recall.  I thought Rosetta Stone did a great job bringing up concepts and reminding me of the concepts later on.  I did not feel the need to review previous lessons...++ PAINLESS.  This system is about as fun (can I say that?) and as painless as a computer aided language learning system can get.NEGATIVES:--- PRICE, PRICE, PRICE -for most people the $200 cost for a single lesson (less as you buy more modules) is really too high.  Yes I know these things cost money, and I know they are better than other systems, but the pricing suggests that they are worried you won\\'t like it, and you\\'ll feel pressured to continue because you spent so much, OR, they are trying to convince you to pay only a few hundred more to get the whole set.  I\\'d argue they\\'d be better off dropping the price in half for the first module, and then I\\'d recommend it more.  (And give me some sort of discount if I buy lesson 2 separately.  I am not going to buy multiple modules without buying the first one, and testing it out.  $500 for the set is too much of a committment without giving it a shot first.)- READING EXERCISES ARE BUGGY SOMETIMES -I have spent 5 minutes (unsuccessfully) on several sections where I am supposed to say just one syllable, and the voice recognition system fails.  I mean, I KNOW what I am hearing, I have studied 4 languages, have good pronunciation, and I can\\'t for the life of me get the computer to believe I said \"PO\" (for example) instead of something unrecognizable.  It was very frustrating, as I tried to enunciate it every way imaginable, with no luck.  Yet, when It was a multi-syllabic word (with the same syllable) the computer had no problem.- NO DICTIONARY -yes, I know this isn\\'t part of their system, but it would have been nice to have a dictionary so that I could learn some additional words on my own.  (Sometimes you just don\\'t want to wait to lesson 5 to learn numbers, for example...)But probably the biggest criticism is that this program is no substitute for classroom participation.  (Yes, I know that there are some online modules that you can pay more for, but I wasn\\'t interested in paying any more...)My wife was taking classroom Italian at the same time I was doing this system, and we would compare experiences.  One thing I noticed is that the \"putting-sentences-together-on-my-own-and-saying-them\" part of Rosetta Stone, was one of the weaker sections.  She, on the other hand, got many opportunities to practice.  Mine was more about listening and comprehension.Overall, if classroom Italian really isn\\'t an option for you, because you don\\'t have the time or you just don\\'t like classrooms, AND you have a lot of money to spend, then I\\'d say this is a good deal.  (If I were forced to move overseas I would definitely invest in the system.)But, if you are a starving student, then you\\'re better off looking for other books and CDs from the library before trying this system.Recommended, but with reservations.',\n",

I learned French the old fashioned way (four years in high school and more in college), so the idea of taking on a new language in a way I had never tried before seemed like an interesting alternative.It was a lot more enjoyable than I thought it would be. I have a smattering of Italian from my family, and this added to it when I began to recognize words I had never seen before, but only heard.It installed on my Mac with no problems. I had a few issues with the microphone, but if you google it (there is help online), I found a fix that worked with little effort.I can't say Level 1 of Rosetta Stone is going to make you speak like a native, but after sampling this, it really does make you want to go onto the next phase, if it's as painless as this was.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I recently used this neck stash on a two week trip to France.  It was wonderful!  I loved it at the airport and at train stations, especially.  It is so helpful to have my hands free yet my passport and bording pass (or train ticket) ready to pull right out instead of fumbling in a purse.  I also carried money and credit cards in it and in extremely crowded tourist areas (like the Eiffel Tower) I wore it under my shirt for extra security.  It's lightweight and the adjustable neck strap, when adjusted properly, makes this pretty unnoticeable under a shirt.  I love the different compartments, as this makes it easier to find what you're looking for right away.\",\n",

They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away at first, not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams. I tried some of the competitors first, but a friend of mine was such an advocate I had to try at least one. I\\'m glad I did. The HeatGear material is perfect. It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me, that means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version. I like the sleeveless version for working out, because it helps your range of motion with your arms. The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt, but the only problem in that context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt. UA has started to offer a sleeved \"Tactical\" version of the shirt, which I might buy one or two, but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster than cotton.  The hold you in place.  You are not as hot as some may be while working hard.  You are armoured.These are entirely worth the money, and I recommend that you buy a half-dozen or so as soon as you can.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This is the only sports bra that I have ever worn that can also be used as a minimizer as well. It worked very good at flattening my big chest making it impossible for the big huge sacks I call breast to even budge one centimeter.The downfalls of this bra is that it is hard to put on the first time and really does not break in and feel comfortable and natural until you have worn the thing many times. Also it took time to put the bra on as it has over 10 hooks to fasten painstakingly one at a time.However, the positive is that I had this same model bra for over 2 years and has survived constant wear, tear, and abuse.To sum up this review it is worth the money if you are up to enduring some discomfort until the bra breaks in and is looking for an excellent minimizer.AS for an actual sports bra for activities where you will be doing alot of moving and flexing of the upper body I do not recommend this bra. You might want to try the Moving Comfort line as they have excellent support for big chests.',\n",

You MUST use the Enell specific sizing chart--as far as I can tell it's not on the Ammy link, so use the website for your measurements!It's Ugly, it squishes, and the fit feels weird at first and did I mention ugly?It's also long lasting, and does what it's supposed to.  Keeps the girls still so I can go running.  I would not wear it for anything but exercise because after I'm done it would get a little uncomfortable.  However, I've done up to 2.5 hrs of running and done sprint triathlons in this bra.There is only one other bra I find as satisfactory (and only discovered it because Enell would not ship to APO/FPO...and in fact would not even ship to a different address to let someone else mail it to me--my BILLING address was FPO and they refused to service that...so don't try and buy this as a gift if you are going through Enell...obviously that was before I could pay for it on Amazon...but I digress).Despite my unhappiness with Enell, I do love the product and I'm vey happy ordering via Amazon has made purchasing this product a viable option again.  Particularly as I start making plans to do another sprint triathlon, this style works very well under my suit.Extremely Highly Recommended for larger busted people who are doing something high impact like running.JTG\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I love this bra.  I am a competitive, thin, fit 44 yo with 34F busts so over the years certain body parts have moved a bit southward and there is a lot of postential for jiggling to outright flopping.  In this Enell Sport Bra I can run and jump with no unwanted movement.  It is a compreesion bra, so you are going to have a mono-boob, but it is the only bra I can run in that does the job without chafing.  And when I am working out hard I'm a make-upless, hair-puled-back, sweaty mess, so what do I care if I have one compressed motionless boob?Most of the negative reviews of this bra are folks who couldn't get into it, so I figured I wuld tell you the easiest way:1. First put your arms through the arm holes as though you were putting on a vest.2. Leave your boobs where they are: if they are down by your lower rib cage, your belly button or tucked into your waistband, just leave there.3. Grasp your Enell Sports Bra by the bottom two front clasps and lift up (vertically) so you are NOT pulling it across your boobs, but over the top of your boobs across your chest at arm pit height.4. Hook the bottom to clasps so that the bra is closed at the bottom but contains no boobs.5. Using your right hand, go through the inside of the bra and scoop up your left boob and pull it ino the bra.  Do the same with your left hand, right boob.6. Arrange your boobs so they are comfortable and facing the same direction, then easiely hook the rest of the clasps from the bottom up.Ta-Da!I will say this is a LOT of bra. If you are a cup size C or smaller this may not be the bra for you.  If you do not do a lot of high impact movements (running, jumping, karate, burpees, pogo-sticking) you probably do not need a bra this sturdy.  For example, I do not need to wear my Enell when I am weight training or biking.  However, if you are an older lady who maybe has had a couple of kids and gravity has done its thing, this may be the bra for you; or if you are a younger gal who is well endowed and have seen your mother naked and don't want the same fate to befall you, then you may want to wear a Enell to ward off the horrors of gravity for as long as possible.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I had a hard time choosing between the size 2 and 3. (42 bust and 37 rib cage)  The 3 seemed like the best fit for the rib cage, but I thought I'd need a 2 to really compress everything.  I'm glad I went with the 3, because if it were any tighter, and it would probably hurt my rib cage.  As it is, it seems just right.When I first put it on, I thought it wouldn't control bounce enough because it felt just a tad roomy in the top part, but it works!  There's still some movement, but it doesn't hurt at all, and I don't feel like the breath is being squeezed out of me.  In fact, I hardly feel constricted at all, other than in the band around my rib cage, and that part isn't uncomfortable at all. The top and bottom control panels do exactly what the video says--they minimize bounce. I did several jumping jacks without a problem.  It's really  hard to believe that it can do that without being squished too much.It does make you look a little like you're wearing body armor, and under a shirt it definitely doesn't look like you're wearing a normal bra.  But I think it looks fine. It just flattens you, and depending on the fabric you're wearing you can sometimes see the seam between the top part of the bra and the bottom support.  Turbo Kick and the elliptical trainer aren't places to have fashion shows, anyway, though, so I'm definitely keeping mine.Shipper, OneSweetOne, was also fast.  I ordered on a Wednesday, got it on a Tuesday--one day earlier than indicated.UPDATE Jan 31st 2012. I wore my bra to a hip-hop aerobics class and it worked great!  We did a lot of jumping around and bouncing, and I enjoyed it more than I've enjoyed aerobics or dancing in YEARS.  I think there's still a shifting movement in the bra, but I honestly don't notice it since it's not impeding my workout. I feel like I have better balance and control as I move.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I've always had a pretty full bust. I remember walking at the track with a friend and trying to jog a bit during the straight stretches...only to have her comment that I really needed to wear a sportsbra to minimize all the bounce. She was shocked when I told her that I actually had two on. Since a pretty dramatic weight gain, the bounce has gotten worse. When I found out my job was sponsoring free zumba classes, I couldn't wait to enroll but felt self-conscious...plus jumping around without good support is very uncomfortable. So when I saw the Enell bra featured on a plus sized fashion blog (with rave reviews), I went ahead and splurged. I have to say that I'm very pleased. The bra compresses but it also provides a lot of lift from below. I feel supported AND lifted instead of just getting squash-chest like the other bras out there. And for the first time since I hit puberty I was able to go for a light jog without feeling like I was pulling a pectoral muscle. Also, because of the unique satin-like material (versus the traditional all-cotton sportsbras), my shirts don't ride up or get stuck on my chest like velcro.Still, I couldn't quite give it a perfect 5-star rating. For one thing, I'm still getting a little bit of a uni-boob. The band fits perfect but the cup size seems a tad small, but I don't want to go up a size and risk not getting a good fit around...speaking of which, it is a bit of an non-traditional fit. The shoulder straps are pretty short and sort of has the bra hiked up in the back...really high. Also, the price makes this a luxury item. I don't know if I will ever own more than one at a time, especially if my weight loss is successful and I go down a size or so. I just hope this bra holds up well with frequent washing.\",\n",

It has a lot of padding which makes my already large breasts look enormous, The cups are moulded and - of course since it's Playtex - they are pointy. I was stunned at how horrible it looked on. Add to that the fact that the underwire and band are very uncomfortable; they don't lie flat against your body, yet they chafe and rub. I've learned my lesson now. I'll never buy Playtex again.\",\n",

And while it does fit great (though runs large), and makeS you feel sexy as all get out, it does NOT work with about 75% of my wardrobe, or most modern wardrobes I would venture, as clingy knits, spandexes and thin t-shirt cottons are the order of day. The back band of the bra sticks WAY out under any rayon-thin, drapey fabric, and that\\'s with the correct size; it is just a clunky kind of bra.But since Amazon sells these Bali Flower Underwire Bras so inexpensively, I decided to keep it anyway. Under thicker shirts the back band is less noticeable (but not the upwards-pointing nipples!).

The cups run generously sized (which for me, as a D/DD usually is a positive thing, but in this design was too much of a good thing & I would have to size down).  The overall design was cute, but the odd sizing made it a no-go.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I used to wear the Jockey for Her cotton briefs.  They fit perfectly and lasted for years.  Several years ago we moved quite far from a Jockey store and I had to try other brands, none of which were close to the quality and fit of the old Jockey for Her briefs.  I was happy to find Jockey underwear on Amazon but since the picture, the name and the description were obviously different from the original briefs I used to wear I ordered only one package of 3 pairs of the Elance briefs.Boy, am I glad I only ordered one package!  I am terribly disappointed that they do not fit comfortably at all.  When I got them out of the package the leg holes looked like they were too large and I think that is the problem. They are definitely not \"full coverage\" and I do not want part of my bum uncovered. At least the cotton knit is nice and soft.Now I will have to try to find another package of the Lollipop brand cotton briefs I bought a year or so ago.  They fit perfectly - just like the Jockey brand used to do.  I will say that the Elance pants are not the worst underpants I have.  I bought a package of Hanes a while ago and they are much worse!After receiving these underpants I did further research and found that what is described as \"PLUS size Classic briefs\" actually are available in the size 6 that I wear.......and that is not a \"PLUS\" size by any means.  If the description had not specified PLUS size I would have looked at those and ordered them and perhaps been more satisfied.  However, I am very hesitant to order any more Jockey underpants because of the problem with the leg openings being too large in the Elance style.',\n",

I just wanted to stay warm. Anyway, when I put the jeggings on I thought they seemed baggy or loose. They've always felt fitted. When I met my friend for lunch she asked me if I was still losing weight because my pants were loose fitting. Ditto for my husband.Spanx work, but darn if I can explain it. They go on easily. While they are fitted to conform to the body they don't feel tight. They are comfortable enough that I forget I'm wearing them.I ordered a medium and since I normally wear an 8 or 10 they are true to size. I have friends who wear plus sizes and tell me the size they wear are consistent with the garment sizes they normally wear.I either hand wash or wash on a gentle cycle using Woolite and air dry.

They reminded me of the girdle-type panty hose toppers. I also discovered the Spanx run a bit small as I ordered the size suggested using the Amazon size chart. I should have gone up one size.I'd suggest saving your money and buying a pair of girdle-type panty hose. They are cheaper and if you are wearing the panty hose for their girdle power they'll last a long time.I'm sending the second pair back, and would have sent both, except when I was attempting to try on the first pair the Spanx panty snagged. Not fair to send it back to the seller, so I will keep the Spanx Power Panty; and squeeze into it when needed.Recommend with caveats given.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'My Domke F-2 arrived yesterday along with the extra padded internal compartment.I decided against the waxed leather because of the reviews where people said that the wax would rub off and instead went with Olive Drab.I moved my outfit into the bag and found that it could hold more than I expected, but of course a lot less than my much larger backpack.The Canon 5D Mark III fits with either the 50mm f/1.4 or the 20-35mm F/2.8L mounted.  The 70-200mm f/2.8L IS will just fit in the compartment with the lenshood reversed. However, the mounting end sticks \"up\" a little more than I would really like. The biggest thing I noticed was a lack of padding in the top flap, I can \"feel\" the endcap on the 70-200 through it. There is a zippered inside pocket on the flap, so I\\'ll probably insert a piece of thinsulite or thin foam in it to give it just a little more padding on top as a \"comfort\"I fit the above lenses, the 2x teleconverter, 430EXii Flash, and accessories inside the main compartment. It\\'s snug, but workable.  If I need more than that, I\\'d probably carry the full size backpack instead (even with the extra weight)I like the well made clips, backed up with a large velcro closure. While the velcro is not \"silent\" for street shooting, the combination will help to make sure that the bag stays closed.The strap is nice and wide, fully adjustable and goes all the way under the bag for extra strength.  There are two large end pockets big enough to carry accessories. Fully loaded, it is heavy, but manageable.Since I didn\\'t get the waxed leather, I plan on spraying it down with some Kiwi Campdry or ScotchGuard to give it a little water repellancy on the outside.After the next few weeks of trips I\\'ll update',\n",

This pair is on around year 3 also and the soles are completely flat in some spots now.  The elastic is stretched permanently and the adhesive is coming undone around the toes.  Some of the rubber is starting to deteriorate along the sides but he leather has no holes or tears. The built in plastic support around the ankle area has cracked on both shoes.  Nevertheless, they are still functional and extremely comfortable.  They keep my feet warm enough in the winter for casual wear but I would not dare use them for winter hiking or other winter sports for fear of frostbite.  Their dry traction seems to be pretty good and wet traction is decent.  Overall, these are a very good shoe.  My measured shoe size is between 9.5 and 10 (closer to 10) but this shoe in 9.5 fits perfect. If I had to approximate my exact size I'd be probably a 9.9.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I have found a new favorite brand! It's so difficult to find clothes that fit when you're big and tall (tall, dark and handsome if I do say so myself). I usually wear the same clothes every year until they wear out but now I have bought a new wardrobe, basically. I've spent $500 or so on Carhartt clothes in the past few months and I don't regret it. I wish they would make sweat pants!These are very thick material, really nice design. I don't mind the big logos like some people--I like how it adds extra color and style. These will last me for years, no doubt about it.Also, these are made very loose. I would say 1 size larger than most cheaper clothes. If I wear one of those generic clothes (which I don't mind wearing btw) I usually have to order like a 5X because they are so small. I definatley like a loose fit so it suits me perfectly. However, if you like your clothes to have a classic, tighter fit I would order a size smaller. Their hoodies are pretty true to size but their long and short sleeve tees I would for sure buy a size smaller.So yeah, these are way more expensive than I normally pay. There are t-shirts I can buy at the mall 5 for $20 but they have literally started falling apart just after one summer. So it's worth it to buy these because I know they will last.Awesome brand! If you're not sure then go ahead and buy it because I don't think you will be disappointed.\",\n",

While I am by no means tiny, Carhartt's version of the venerable t-shirt is only a couple notches shy of a gown on my frame. You gotta be a big corn-fed American boy to sport one of these.Running it through the dryer made it worse; the neck hole shrank but the other dimensions remained almost unchanged. Even the pocket sits forlornly off to the side, as if seeking the shelter of my armpit. This is possibly the most awkward t-shirt I've ever bought.\",\n",

Ditto on most brands of khakis, the office rat's jeans.  After purchasing a couple pairs of Carhartt's excellent khakis, I decided to try their jeans.  I have never before had a better fit in a pair of jeans,or a more correct sizing of the waist and inseam.  They are so comfortable my wife has to steal them away to wash them, so I got more of them. I have several Carhartt products and I can assure you they are made for maximum durabilty, value and comfort for the working man.  The relaxed fit version is especially comfortable on horseback because it allows your legs to move without pulling down the waist.  Best ever jeans!!And the best source I found for price and prompt delivery was Amazon.  If they say they have it, you get it quick and well packed.\",\n",

I am at the weird end of the spectrum body type wise, and am very skinny, but long legged.  A 30\" waist but a 34\" inseam...yeah, I am all leg!  My son is better proportioned and has a 32\" waist and 30\" inseam.  Finding jeans that fit me is difficult.  But, thankfully, Carhartt has pants that fit me.  I really enjoy the jeans I got, except for the fact that they only have 5 belt loops instead of the 7 I am used to.  My son\\'s relaxed fit jeans are great. He wears them frequently.  He is into body building and needs a jean that does\\'t fit too tightly to his thighs (which are understandably quite large now).  So these relaxed fit jeans fill the bill nicely.  He doesn\\'t feel pinched or bound up in them and finds them to be all-day comfortable.  Construction is rugged and quality is excellent.  They fit well and wash/dry well.  These are really high quality jeans and worth the price.  Oh, and the price was very NICE.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I bought this shoe(9.5 W, chocolate nu buck) because of glowing tributes on this and other sites. The shoe felt great on trying it on initially. I agree with other reviewers that the supplied thin PU insole is laughably thin, and non supportive, creating a false aura of roominess and comfort which does not stand up to(pun intended) prolonged non-recumbency. It DOES NOT have the ADIPRENE insoles that most other Rockports do. The unusually THICK TONGUE covers most of the dorsum (Top) of the foot....and competes for room...you have to open up the laces wide to accommodate it, or your arch top will start hurting. I tried a comfort insole, but it left little room for my toes. I banished the shoe to the back of my rack. Recently(after 3 months), I revisited the shoe, and remembered my previous travails. I trashed the insole first. Then I progressively stuffed paper napkins into the toe and ball area, leaving it overnight for a few days, to stretch it. Finally I equipped it with a my favorite spenco insoleSpenco Polysorb Cross Trainer, Women's 9-10 / Men's 8-9. So, after a few days of foot & heartache, and a few hours daily D&C; (dilatation and curettage), the shoe is very usable and comfortable for my 12-18 hour duties as a physician. In the mean time, I discovered and am using a pair ofClarks Men's Wave.Tract Lace Upwhich are very comfortable and supportive without any modifications for my purpose of prolonged walking and standing.Addendum: some musings after 18 months of occasional use: 1/6/1014,I have worn this shoe about 50-60 times, and they look and feel great. It has a wide flat platform, and is great/stable for standing, but not as good as some other more modern designs for prolonged walking. The nubuck leather (color is more medium tan rather than chocolate as advertised) has maintained its finish, thanks in part to initial treatment withKiwi Suede and Nubuck Protector, 4.25 ozand occasional use ofKiwi Suede Nubuck CleanerI reach out for these shoes when I want a tan colored shoe that I will wear all day. They fit a little high around the anke, and I tend to use them more in spring and fall, when it is not rainy. With my sporadic use, and some TLC it seems they will last forever.\",\n",

The metal seems substantial enough to last.Cleans the gunk off boots and should easily keep the amount of snow off of our waterhog carpet at our back entry door.The bad:Rusts easily. I suspected this thing rusted rather easily looking at other peoples scrushers. I thought that I would add an extra coat of Rustoleum at the beginning of the this season to prevent it from rusting as easily. However.....When I removed the brushes it was already rusting in various spots before my new scrusher has even seen outside duty. This is not ideal and makes me feel like it is lower quality than I had anticipated.Normally, I expect that metal will potentially rust over a winter in the snow belt. The environment isn't very kind to metal things in our neck of the woods so I already do yearly rustoleum duty to slow the damage down on various metal objects I have. But,I don't expect a new item to be rusting in a few spots right when I buy it.I wish things could be made the way I imagined they were 20 years or so ago, when I was younger. It seems like powder coating should be more substantial and complete. Perhaps it is a sign of our age, but I yearn for better quality and longevity.These days, it seems that in order to give things longevity, I have to do a lot of prevention and maintenance myself. Not a big problem since I am used to it to a degree, but I hope for more.\",\n",

I screwed a piece of scrap board into the bottom brushes from below (through the drill holes), which works fine, but requires fairly exact measurement.  The board extends @ 9 inches to each side of the brush.  I stand on the board with my off foot so that it is firmly anchored when I brush each shoe.The fit is very tight, which is necessary for the brush to remove debris thoroughly.  I suspect that reviewers who complain of the tight fit for large shoes have not attached an anchoring board.The product would be improved by the inclusion of instructions for attaching an anchor board.Because I have a small back porch, I have to keep the apparatus a few feet away on a paved surface.',\n",

I had no trouble inserting them and little difficulty putting the back on. Even my big man\\'s fingers were able to put the back on the post. Maybe it was beginner\\'s luck because I have struggled with other stud earrings with equally small backs.I like the 5mm size. It seems to be just the right size for a man. Attractive without being ostentatious. I only have one earlobe pierced so buying earrings in pairs means I always have a spare. Right now I expect to get many years of pleasure from these earrings. If my opinion should change I will try to remember to update this review.ETA: I almost forgot to tell you. These earrings actually come with a \"Made in America\" tag. That made me very happy I ordered them.UPDATE after 2 months: Well, they were nice while they lasted. It\\'s a good thing I have that spare earring. I\\'ve had to change this review from 5 stars to 3 stars. The ear nuts that came with them are apparently a little loose. I lost one earring after wearing it for about a week so I\\'ve purchased replacement ear nuts. Hopefully they will work better than the originals.To be honest, I wear an earring 24/7 including when sleeping or showering.  I\\'ve been doing that for several years and this is the first time I\\'ve completely lost an earring. I\\'ve had some come loose but they loosened gradually enough that I always felt it before the ear nut came off completely. The reviewed earring must have come loose and fallen out quickly enough that I didn\\'t feel anything.FURTHER UPDATE: I found the earring that had fallen out and tried a spare ear nut on it. I had purchased several different sizes here on Amazon and found an ear nut that fit snugly enough I don\\'t think I have to worry about it coming off. This earring is now back on the ones-I-like-to-wear list. I intend to go through all of my stud earrings and replace any ear nuts I suspect will not hold well.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"All I wanted was a pair of hoop earring, yellow or white gold. I've worn this style as every day earrings for years and managed to lose one. These looked perfect and in spite of the outrageous increase of the price of gold, I decided to order them. The size was exactly as described and would have indeed been perfect except for the following: the part that goes into the piercing is not the usual wire. Instead it is a thin flat piece of gold that is significantly wider in diameter than a wire and was terribly uncomfortable. If you are a person with stretched out piercings, this may not bother you, but it was a deal breaker for me. The second problem is that earrings like this must have a good closure. ONE of them had a very tight closure- almost too tight but I could have lived with that. The other was so loose that it would have definitely come unhooked and I would have lost it. Needless to say, I was terribly disappointed. If you are a person who is used to wearing larger diameter earrings, I would say this could be a good deal if you get a pair with decent closures. They're beautiful and shiny and an excellent size. But if you're like I am and thick earrings hurt you, look for ones with wire style clasp backs.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"After all the reviews I read, and the ones my friends told me, I am confused. These 501 shrink to fit jeans shrunk about one inch in the waist, and about an inch and a half in length exactly as advertised and exactly as the first ones I got in the first grade in 1962. These jeans are not as tough as they used to be but neither am I. They will last for me just fine. I can not beat Amazon's price around here unless they are on sale, and not everyone's sale. I ordered them on the ninth and they arrived on the eighteenth. I guess I am spoiled by Amazon because I usually get my stuff faster than that. I guess all in all the whole deal was as good as it always is. The jeans fit perfectly when I got them and after the wash they were a little tight, but after I wear them some they will stretch back to perfect, same as always. The last Levis I ordered came from Mexico, these came from Haiti and there was no difference in the quality at all. I will order them again.\",\n",

However, after receiving it I have found that I prefere a solid blue face as compared to this more modern style of the blue appearing differently depending on how the light happens to be hitting it.  This is personal taste, I just found that for me I don't particularly care for it.  It is a very beautiful watch and extremely light on the wrist, so even though I found I don't personally care for the style after receiving it I still gave it five stars.

       "  'reviewText': \"First of all, this is my first skagen purchase. I came across this watch at my local macy's and looking at the $135 price tag I was hesitant and thankfully I was. I came on amazon and found one for 68 dollars, it was such a steal. Now just to get it out of the way, if you are wondering wether to buy this watch or not, you should absolutely. You will not be dissapointed. The price of this watch seems to fluctuate a lot on amazon so never be imaptient and buy it if it's over 80 dollars, just wait it out and check regularly because I am pretty sure you will find one within 68-79 dollars.Now on to the watch. I'll break it down so it's easy for you guys to understand everythingDial - The dial is a dark blue but, when it's exposed to light, it's reflection looks gorgeous and will capture people's attention without a doubt.Glass - The glass of the watch is very thick and scratch resistant. It also reflects off light and is very shiny and clear. When you see smudges just take a nice piece of cloth and wipe it once or twice and for sure it will look brand new again.Strap - Most buyers of this product complain about how hard is it to make the strap the right size for them. Honestly, it took me 1 minute to figure out how to do it. The instruction manual shows it very clearly, all you have to do is take a screwdiver or any other object that fits in the hole. Just enter the object and push it backwards and the clasp will open. Once it opens just move it back or forward depending on what size you need and just press it down tightly and that's it your done.Strap (look) - The look of the strap is my favorite thing about the watch. The material is very thick and metallic. It is very shiny and reflects off light like the rest of the watch. The reflection of the light on the strap gives the watch the elegant look and people for sure will know right away that it's an expensive watch.Comfort - The watch is very light. When left on sometimes you might forget that you even have a watch on, however since it is summer now I did come across one thing that irritated me. I like wearing the watch a little tight and when your in a warm environment your arm will sweat and make the strap feel a little sticky and make it itchy, but then again 90% of all watch straps will make you feel the same way so it's not a huge deal. Overall, it is very comfortable, light and great for everyday use.Overall GradesPerformance - 10Durability - 10Looks - 10Comfort - 9\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I have had a Skagen 800 series watch that I liked very much. The only way to replace the band when the black starts to turn silver is to send it back to Skagen in Texas for replacement. That costs $32 and includes anything else you want done, like changing the battery. I really love the watch and felt is was worth it. However, I felt so naked without it, and they said it takes 2-3 weeks to return, that I bought another one.The diameter of this watch is smaller, it is very thin and perfect for slender wrists like mine. I love the band. You adjust it once and it stays that size forever, looks great and doesn't absorb perspiration like leather. The color is rich and reflective and goes with everything. If you like a thin watch, rather than the big bulky ones that are so popular now, this is for you.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I am so hard on watches and this watch has made it through it all. I LOVE my Skagen and probably will never buy another brand of watch.My particular one is fairly water resistant, I\\'ve splashed water in and near it, and even put my hand into the turtle tank once when I had to get the turtle out when the lightbulb got wet, exploding sharp glass all over. I didn\\'t have a moment to take off the watch, so in it went. It came out fine. I do not usually immerse this watch although I don\\'t take it off to wash my hands or scrub dishes before they go into the dishwasher. I wouldn\\'t immerse it often though.In 5 years of ownership, I wore this watch almost every day for the first 4. Then I bought 2 more Skagen watches to expand my \"wardrobe.\" That should tell you something right there. Here\\'s my analysis:Pros:*Many Skagens have this mesh bracelet. It is WONDERFUL and I can\\'t say enough about it. Hypoallergenic, breathable like no other band. I\\'m allergic to everything, my skin is so acidic it will literally eat the chrome finish off of things. Not so with this watch, since it\\'s surgical stainless steel.*In 4 years, I have had to replace the battery once. Great battery life.*Attractive, gets comments.*Flashy flat glass gets attention and if you can\\'t read, just tilt to angle and it works great.*Love the sparkly little crystals.*Matching brushed silver face.*Easily adjustable band. Takes a small screwdriver to pry up the clamping clasp. Easy.*Good locking safety clasp. If the catch gets loose, just give it a little pressure from pliers and it becomes tight again.*Super low profile. Sits close to your wrist which helps out on the first \"con\"Cons:*All Skagens have low-quality glass. It does chip, scratch, etc. I\\'m very hard on watches so it\\'s definitely taken some abuse. It still looks good though-- that was the only thing that made it lose a star. I wish Skagen had a more expensive line with real sapphire crystals, I\\'d be willing to pay more. They are WORTH IT.*No second-hand.',\n",

I have had several pair of MBT shoes and at $200+ a pair, it has been difficult to give up on them and realize that they cause more pain for me these days in my lower back.  I needed a change of pace.I have to say that some of the arch and insole features that other people mention (like the ridge that hits behind the toes) have been no problem for me and have actually helped.  In order to avoid the potential \"smell\" that some people have complained of, I bought2 Toms Stink-Free Deodorizer Spray - 8 oz.to use beforehand to try to avoid any bacterial build-up that might contribute to any unwanted odors.After researching and researching some more, I discovered that people with back or foot problems like me (Morton\\'s Neuroma) and lumbar/sacral and knee problems just need solid shoes with a good arch and a wide enough toebox.  Odd as they look at first, I found myself quickly amenable to them when I realized that they were actually supporting my knees and back and I could climb multiple steps of stairs and make my way around without a lot of pain ... that was pretty fantastic to me.  Just one thing about me, I have MS, so the walking I do is usually a little stiffer and more prone to pain.  If I can discover and adjunct shoe like Keen to make it a bit easier, I am a happy camper.5 Stars for Keen.Also, since I\\'ve read they can get a little ripe and smelly, I decided to pick up a bottle of Tom\\'s2 Toms Stink-Free Deodorizer Spray - 8 oz..I worn them for about a week, comfy right out the box.

       "  'reviewText': 'I got a pair of Neport sandals this spring and have been using them for 2-3 months now. I couldn\\'t make up my mind if I should buy these or the \"Newport H2\" model. The difference seems to be that the H2 is using some \"water friendlier\" material than leather for the outer layer and the H2 have 100% rubber sole while the Newport have some leather upper layer on the sole that makes it more comfortable.I chose the Newport because I thought I was going to use them occasionally for \\'street use\\' but if I could make the choice again I would probably select the H2 because apparently I see to use them only for hiking. The leather layer does not even come in contact with your feel anyway so I\\'m not really sure what\\'s the point.These sandals are great! Here\\'s what I like about them:\\\\* super comfortable. You can wear them all day and never feel the need to take them off.* Hold your feet very well. I haven\\'t tried super difficult trails but I have tried dry trails, creeks, boulders, you name it. They just won\\'t quit.* Sole has very good grip. They do not slip and slide even when wet.* toe protection is great* nice reflective stripes on front and back* it takes a second to wear them or take them offThey are not perfect though:* they take a longer to dry when they get soaking wet then I would have expected* they are a bit on the heavy side. I was surprised when I first lifted them out of the box. But you get used to this* the price you pay for the good hold and grip is I guess some less air. When it\\'s really hot outside, your feet will get a bit warm. These are no flip flops...Note that I had to pick up size 9. I normally wear 8 or 8.5 max.',\n",

I wear them around the house and they keep my feet warm and if I need to throw on some boots and take my dog for a walk or run out, they keep my feet warm in the outdoor weather.  They are cushioned but not so much that you can't wear them with regular sneakers.  Smartwool socks are the best I have found for winter socks to keep my feet warm.  My only recommendation is to make sure you get the right sized socks because if they are too tight, even a little too tight, it will reduce circulation which creates cold feet.

My sister was one and I promised her one for her birthday! I found it quite roomy and could have probably bought a medium for myself....hence I bought the medium for my sister. It can be squished into a ziplock bag taking no space in your pack. It is warm and washes and dries quickly overnight. All in all a very useful item for travelling!Jenn, BC\",\n",

If you look closely at the pictures you will see the difference.  Instead of shoe laces, they have sewn in elastic.  And rather than sturdy construction, they are flimsy with no reinforced padding at the heel.  They would not be at all comfortable.  It appears that the beige/brown choice is the same.  These should not be sold along side the others.  Wish I could do a separate one star review on the blue.  These are going back.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I bought these because I was looking for a workout shoe that I could wear with black pants, that wouldn\\'t make my feet look like they were in a sci-fi movie. (Although, I do love to watch the TV show Eureka!) I was happy that they were vegan, as well.I went to four different B&M; stores, tried on dozens of pairs of shoes and was beginning to think that my feet had suddenly grown in some weird fashion (no pun intended), as NONE of them fit properly. I tried on various sizes, from various brands, in various styles and nothing was right. It was soooo frustrating!I ordered these in what I previously thought to be \"my size\" (women\\'s 10), based on others\\' reviews and whew, was I happy when they arrived and fit PERFECTLY!I wore them around the house for a bit to make sure, then to work for a full day of light duty stuff, yesterday to the gym for some precor and rowing machine work, and then, today, to the gym for a lo-impact workout. So far, so good! They are SOOOO comfortable AND - BONUS: they make my feet look smaller! This was confirmed by my mom, when she exclaimed this upon seeing them for the first time.Fit points (in all shoes) that matter to me:- toe room: these have a good amount of it, so toes can wiggle, but not so much that the foot is unstable or the toe box looks huge.- stitching in toe area: At first, I thought the bar of stitching that runs across the top of my foot, at the base of my toes, would irritate me, but I only noticed it the first hour or so and haven\\'t noticed it since.- the area around the Achilles tendon: again, just the right amount of room (shoes usually bend forward too much for me, not these)- arch: i dunno if i have flat feet or not, but I do love a nice hefty arch. These have a good one, with a smooth transition from the rest of the surface.- sole width: some shoes seem narrower in the sole, even though the shoe might fit, thus causing my foot to look like it\\'s floating or hanging over the edge - ick! These are just right in sole width.PROS:- sized right (for me, anyway!)- comfy!- nice style (simple, but not boring; old-skool, but not out of style)- vegan! Saucony\\'s site claims: \"This Vegan friendly Saucony shoe contains no animal products, by-products or derivatives. Canvas and hemp create the classic design.\"- TWO pairs of shoestrings (mine came wearing a black pair, and with an oatmeal pair in the box) - this helps to match your style & I find I get more use from an old pair of kicks, when I spruce them up with some new laces!- women\\'s sizes 5-12, with half-sizes from 5.5 to 9.5- the insole is removable!- so many great colors!!!CONS:- the frayed cotton look on the oatmeal parts does make it look a little scraggly. (as mentioned by another reviewer) but it\\'s not totally noticeable and, some may even think it gives the shoe a bit of \"granola\" charm. Mine seem a bit more frayed than the pic shows. I\\'m on the fence and could take it or leave it. We\\'ll see in the coming months, if it deteriorates faster than expected.NOTE:there is a good bit of chunky traction on this shoe. This will certainly help on the trail, but causes a noticeable amount of grip on smooth floors. I find it tolerable (even a bit soothing, as pressure on the various tread triangles gives my foot a bit of a \"massage\" while I move around), and the added grippiness is a minor concern for me, compared to my other preferences, but if this is an area of major concern for you, you might be bothered by it. This might decrease, as the tread wears a bit. If I notice, I\\'ll update.CONCLUSION:Active vegans have another reason to rejoice! And, so do active non-vegans, or non-active vegans! These shoes are super-cute, cool, comfy, and caring to animals, and indirectly, the planet! They fit great (true-to-size) and can be worn confidently! With so many great colors and the guarantee of a good fit and function, I will be back to buy more! Thanks, Amazon!I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions. I hope this review helped you in the same manner! :)',\n",

As for the day and month setting,I just can not get the stem in right position for that feature,I am not interested in the month and day setting,but would be nice if easier to use.I like the 10 year battery as the instructions state,I remember not too long ago having to get new battery about once a year.Another good watch at a good price that looks more expensive than it cost from Timex.

       "  'reviewText': 'This velcro strap makes this watch the most comfortable I\\'ve ever worn, and I\\'m 65 so I\\'ve worn quite a few. I have trouble with normal watchbands - buckle straps, links, and stretch. Buckles are the worst for me, the holes are never quite right so a comfortable fit lets the watch drop over to the outside of my wrist, plus the buckle tends to dig into my wrist when occasionally flexed forward. Metal links with clasps are hit or miss for sizing and a big hassle to change. The metal stretch bands are comfy-sized but can pull wrist hair like a band-aid when removed. This strap keeps the watch exactly in place without being too tight. It\\'s almost infinitely ;) adjustable. I\\'ve now worn this watch DAY AND NIGHT for almost two weeks, only removing it as a precaution for a daily shower. Mostly I don\\'t even know it\\'s on. One small quibble about the strap, after fitting it on there\\'s a huge amount of velcro left exposed, it appears to have been designed to tighten up on a small child\\'s wrist. This exposed velcro picks up dust. But I use a clothing lint brush on it to good effect. Also comfort-wise, a brief word about the crown. Unlike most watches it\\'s so small it doesn\\'t dig into my wrist with my hand bent back, yay! Other pros and cons:PROs: Very easy to set the time, very easy to read. The hands glow fine in the dark, at least up close, and then there\\'s the incomparable INDIGLO for a full reading. White on black looks cool. Some other user review I read said that this watch is standard U.S. Army issue even for combat. If true that should speak to its durability and reliability. Actual TIME KEEPING seems fine, checking it against Windows time shows it\\'s lost about 10 seconds in a week. To set it just be on the right minute, wait for the second to read 12, pull the crown, observe the Windows second hit zero, push the crown in. Close enough for government work!CONs: SCRATCHES TOO EASILY! I\\'ve been wearing this watch pretty much around the clock since January 2012. The plastic NOT MINERAL face is now very scratched up. I don\\'t do much manual work, this is I\\'d guess 90% from just slight bumps on door jambs. Another couple of years and I expect it to be too scratched for easy reading. That\\'s a shame because the rest of it seems durable. How this could be standard Army issue is beyond me. I won\\'t order one again, next time mineral face.I\\'m glad I check today\\'s date on a calendar, as this date window is too small for me to read. Moreover, I can\\'t even set the date without a hassle. The manual (get the PDF at Timex, the included paper is barely readable) says: PULL crown to \"middle\" position and turn CLOCKWISE until correct day appears. If day does not change, pull crown to \"out\" position and turn CLOCKWISE or COUNTERCLOCKWISE through necessary number of 24 hour periods until correct day appears.I just cannot find the \"middle\" position and since it\\'s so many days off I\\'m not about to go through the s-l-o-w 24 hour period setting to get the date right. Also, if it\\'s this simplistic how does it account for 30 vs 31 vs 28 day months? For me it doesn\\'t matter because I can\\'t read it anyway.[...]',\n",

It reminds me to check back in a set period of time. Digital watches have too many buttons to push, taking way too long to set an alarm. This analog watch's ability to quickly set an alarm of varying time periods is marvelous. I can't believe Timex is the only manufacturer of this type. It has this model and one that is shinier/dressier. This is the one I wear every day. I hope Timex continues to make these into the far future. If there is one thing I wish Timex would improve on, it is the volume of the alarm. I'm now in my 60s, and of course, losing higher frequencies. The alarm can be difficult for my aging ears to hear if the ambient noise is great. I don't think that this is a defect in the watch. I think it's a defect in me...  :-)\",\n",

It took the licking and kept on ticking for years with the original battery. Just too banged up to be presentable. So before the 3rd band wore out, and the battery failed... I decided to just buy a new one here. In a nutshell, Great watch... Easy to use... and a great price on Amazon.Mark from CANADA!',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I like the Timex for travel. It is inconspicuous and not flashy and it has an easy to read dial in any light and it has an alarm. I don't believe in going to a country and wearing a watch that obviously cost as much as the locals earn in a year. It is not smart and it is not kind and it definitely would end up costing me more when I negotiate for any goods or services which are often on a sliding scale with foreigners charged 3-4x as much. I would rather pay 2x what the locals are charged and recommend leaving your bling at home. It is also 4 times as accurate as a Rolex or similar anachronistic timepiece that people seem to crave for status alone, so if you do need a watch for navigation without a GPS or for when the GPS packs it in, a digital watch is the way to go.When I need to get up and leave for the airport or some other time critical destination I do not like to rely on hotel alarm clocks or wakeup calls. I carry a travel alarm but I also like having the Timex available as a backup alarm.Battery life is exceptional and I have gone three years without replacing the battery. I do not use the light function much which may be part of the reason for the long battery life. With its white dial and analog display I do not need the light the way I would with a digital display.\",\n",

It is lightweight to the point of not even realizing you have it on. The module itself is great. Keeps great time, and setting it is a breeze with the prompts you receive on the screen of the watch during setting mode...great feature.I have used it during chainsaw operation, fence building, and various other jobs and it never misses a beat.

I'm usually about a 7.5, and I bought a 6.5 (slightly tight) and a 7 (slightly loose).  They are so, so wonderful for casual hikes/walks, especially if there's water involved.  They don't work for me for all day, though, I get horrible foot cramps if I walk in them for over 2hrs straight.  So I always bring an extra pair of shoes to trade out if needed.  The other thing is, if you wear them all day, they start to stink.  Like super-strong, super-nasty foot-sweat disgusting stink.  And heck, keen might have fixed this in the couple models since mine.  So, I don't wear them all day, or make sure that if I do it's for some outdoor and watery activity.  I love how these wash in the washing machine.  And they're almost in the condition I bought them in, so well have they held up.  My husband also got a pair (the men's) and one of the straps is starting to pull up from the leather, but he's really hard on things with his man-ness.  He does absolutely love his, too, though.\",\n",

Mine are the Coffee Liqueur/Ceramic ones and the color in the picture is very accurate.+ Good for running errands, short walks, gardening, basic running around stuff.+ Easy to get on and off+ Washable.  No damage after washing (I use the delicate cycle and let air dry which inside to dry completely took about a day...outside less than a day)+ Cord pulls nice and tight and stays that way, I don't have to keep adjusting it.+ Great for riding my bikeCons- Slippery when wet. If I go in water or if my feet start to sweat (which they seem a little more prone to do in these), they get slippery.  Not to where my feet come competely out of them, but it's still annoying.  I have to pull them super tight to avoid them coming off when wet.  That is my biggest complaint since these are H2 water shoes.- They stink. If I wear them all day especially during high heat...they stink really bad, to the point I have to wash them after only one day.  My Keens before have never been like that.- Not that comfortable with long wear.- Made in China.  For the price of these shoes, you'd think they were made here and I'm disappointed that they aren't for that price.\",\n",

The salesperson said she wore this bra all the time while her baby was breastfeeding!  The salesperson helped me find the correct size so that the underwires do not pinch my breast tissue, which can lead to clogged ducts.  I actually only pump since my baby never learned to breastfeed, but it\\'s very easy to unsnap the front to pump.  The stretchy cups accomodate size changes throughout the day from breastfeeding, and the underwires make it so much more flattering than the wire free bras I\\'ve tried.  My only complaint is that the cups are very thin, so I need to wear nursing pads to prevent \"headlights\" -- for this reason, I will not wear these bras once I\\'m done breastfeeding and will go back to a padded or molded cup style.',\n",

Gee, those things are wonderful!I can say it is a pretty bra and fits nicely (true to size since I ordered online!) and does really flatter. It is sexy and feminine and looks good under my clothes.My only negative comments would be that I find it really itchy. There\\'s a piece that is right above the cups that itches so much and rubs that it leaves red marks. Also, if I\\'m wearing a blouse and a blazer, it makes my straps slide down - the multi-layers seem to move the straps.December 2012 Update:I would actually rate this a 3.5 star and changed the review to reflect that. For the price, and the itchiness, it\\'s really a little more than \"ok\".I have since ordered this bra, below, and I find the design and fit about comparable, but more comfortable, and certainly not itchy for a third of the price:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012N4VOA/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00',\n",

They last for years too which is amazing.  I finally replaced some after going through a pregnancy and stretching some out.

       "  'reviewText': \"I have a pair of 505 in the same size as the new pair I ordered on Amazon.  The previous pair was bought on sale at a local Fred Meyer.  They were durable and fit well.  They actually lasted over a year with frequent wearing and once per week washing (I estimate around 40-50 washes).  So I bought the same size and fit on Amazon just in a darker color to wear at work.  I also bought a pair of the 515 slim fit Levi's a few weeks ago and they were perfect and fit exactly the same as another pair I own.  But I wanted the less 'slim' fit of the 505s for work, also wanted the regular and not low rise waist.  So I ordered the same exact size and style:Bad idea!The 505s I got came with a tag saying 'sits below waist', which is NOT what they used to say.  Before, the 505s were a zipper fly version of the 501s.  Putting the pair of 505s I already owned next to the new pair from Amazon, I could see the crotch to waist was almost an inch shorter on the new pair.  Trying the new pair on, I discovered a most unpleasant sensation of my 'man parts' being crushed in agonizing ways.  No amount of tugging would get the pants to sit right.Then I tried on the 515 slim jeans, and they were actually ROOMIER in the crotch area.  The thighs were a little slimmer than the 505s, but the seat was the main difference.  No sag in the seat of the 515s compared to the 505.And then in trying on the recently purchased 515s (in the same color as the new 505s I purchased) I noticed something interesting.  The denim in the new pair was thinner and tougher feeling than in the 515s.  It wasn't just the feeling of the jeans prior to washing.  The 515s never felt that tough, and the denim was thicker in the side by side comparison.I returned them based on a misleading product description (no mention of low rise waist) and inferior quality.  I gave the 515s a 5 star rating because they were as good as the previous 515s that I bought at a high price from a department store.  The previous 505s were also great (Fred Meyer of all places - though they don't have the 505s anymore... booo).  So I'm sticking with the 515s until something changes with them.  I'll take the slightly low waist and save my manhood.  And the better quality denim means they'll last longer anyway.  So here are my comparisons:Levi's 505 purchased 9/10/12 from Amazon - 1 starLevi's 505 purchased fall 2011 from Fred Meyer - 5 starLevi's 515 purchased 6/22/2012 from Amazon - 5 starJust be aware that the product might differ slightly from what is described, and that the quality appears to vary from order to order.  I suspect that is why the great divide in 1 and 5 star reviews.  I love Levi's jeans, and I will continue to buy them, but I will be a little more careful with the online purchasing.  And remember, if you buy from Amazon, they will return or exchange any unwashed clothing items.\",\n",

And they are terribly, terribly inconsistent. In the most recent instance, I ordered two pairs from the same seller through Amazon, in different colors. What I've noticed over the last few years is that different colors appear to be made by different foreign factories -- some in Mexico, some in China, some in Bangladesh, etc. And depending on where they are made, the weight of the fabric and the actual fit is quite inconsistent. When I order these things, I want/expect them to fit the same way, every color, every time. Not an unreasonable expectation, I think. Levi Strauss was able to achieve this for quite a number of years. Evidently, though, like most other American businesses they have simply ceased to give a rip, opting for comparatively inexpensive labor and compromised quality. Makes me frickin' sad.\",\n",

I have bought the dark stonewashed, black and silver fox. The silver fox was a thinner and softer type of material and I liked it a lot! The best thing about ordering your jeans through amazon is that you can always find your size. I have always had a hard time finding 36x36 in the 505's. It's minimally more expensive but at least I know they will have what I need. No more frustration of hunting through the stack of jeans at a store hoping that someone put your size in the wrong bin!4 stars because these jeans are still no where near the same quality of the jeans I got in the early 80's when they were made in america. I hold onto them hoping I will eventually fit back into my 34 waist. If you have any original levi's before 1985 I would hold onto them. They are in great demand. They have everything going for them. They are high quality original Made in America blue jeans and are now retro. win-win. if you have ANY levi's from the 50's and 60's they can easily command $500 or more depending on the condition. Children sizes are the most in demand because they were well worn and sell the best, so they are the hardest to find.*update* 8-7-2012My fourth pair was not sewn right. It was a pair of the Dark Stonewash and the seam on the right leg would rotate to the top of my knee when sitting.

When i first opened the packaged they reminded me of my old 529 which are unfortunately no longer on the product line.  The fit of the jeans is good depending on sizing though.  I ordered one 32 waist and two 34 waist and the amount of variance in sizes is amazing.  One of the 34s ran small and the other ran big.  The bigger of the two seemed like almost a 36 and the smaller of the two was almost 2 inches different.  Not to mention that one of the jeans was mislabeled as 32x34 but was actually a 34x32 according to both the inside tag and the brown tag on the back waistband.  You better order a few and play with the sizes to find something that works.  I really liked the look and feel of the tumbled rigid but the silver fox color has a very thin and cheap feeling material.  I wouldn't recommend those.  I already have a gray 501 that is much better looking.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"While I am a big fan of vintage foundation garments this is my first long leg panty girdle. I typically prefer either an open bottom girdle or panty girdle which I wear with gartered stockings. However, I started looking for a girdle that would provide me with some thigh control as well as addressing my other problem areas. I was a bit skeptical at finding a long leg girdle that would fulfill my needs and still be comfortable and feminine. I am a fan of some of Rago's foundation garments and came across the Rago High Waist Long Leg Shaper Girdle and decided to give it a try based on it's feminine look and my luck with past Rago purchases.It actually fit and looked better on me than I thought it would. I find that it does a great job of addressing my trouble spots and makes my clothes look better on me. It also helps in improving my posture and gives me a more feminine look. My job requires me to spend a lot of time sitting so comfort and posture control are very important. The lace is soft and doesn't bind and I also find the split crotch a very convenient feature. Another plus is that I can wear this girdle without worrying about the legs rolling up if I am not wearing stockings.While the medium fits me well, it can be a bit challenging to get it on. I sometimes use some powder to help it slide up.This girdle is definitely not going to be for all of you girls, but if you're looking for something that you can comfortably wear for long periods of time and that has strong midsection and thigh control as well as aid in improving your posture then you should consider giving this girdle a try.\",\n",

I have gotten so many compliments on it from friends, women at the gym, and my boyfriend (I don't think I've ever gotten complimented on a regular, everyday bra before, only the special occasion stuff). It seems very true to size and is comfy. Unlike some demi bras, the cups are cut low enough that it doesn't show out of the top of scoopneck shirts or tank tops. Another think I love about it is that the strap adjustment ring is in the front, not in the back, so it's easy to adjust perfectly, with out having to call in a friend for help lol.

At some point, the Levis brand started to suffer in terms of quality/value for the dollar.  Don't remember exactly when that happened, but I started to buy my jeans from Banana Republic.  Over time, they stopped making the style I grew to rely on.  This created a 7-10 stretch where I couldn't seem to find a good pair of jeans.  Most recently, I purchased a pair of Lucky jeans - ridiculously over priced.  When those began to fail, I tried Levis again and bought these.

       "  'reviewText': 'The past month or so, I\\'ve really been splurging as much as I can afford to on new bras in my new, \\'real\\' size.  So I\\'ve tried out three different brands so far, and my most recent addition to my lingerie drawer has been the Panache Tango II balconette Superbra.  What can I say?  It is absolutely the most comfortable bra I have ever worn.  EVER.  Online, the bra does get mixed reviews--you either love it or you hate it, apparently--and I\\'ve read speculations that it all boils down to shape, not size.  Personally, I am \"fuller on the bottom\" and ever-so-slightly wide-set, and the shape I find my Tango II gives me is outstanding.  It has a muted retro vibe going on, I wouldn\\'t call the shape \"pointy\" like some others have, but it\\'s not the round look that is so popular nowadays, either.  I don\\'t mind that.My Tango II in \\'nude\\' was a gamble of a purchase, I thought I might be a different size by Panache standards and I was right--so it fits perfectly!  (Note: The first bra in my \\'new\\' size that I purchased for myself, online and with my eyes closed, was of a brand that runs small in the band.  I ordered a 30 and have been wearing it often, but I read later the brand\\'s 30-sized bands \"fit like 28\" and so suspected I\\'m really a 28 to most other companies\\' sizing systems [and up a cup size, of course].  So at least with my Tango II, my musings and additional, awkward self-measuring sessions worked out to my benefit.) I am so happy, it is a well-constructed bra that doesn\\'t dig in, it \"breathes\", and it\\'s lovely to look at and wear.  Granted, I\\'ve not worn it yet under a white shirt but under a knit top that can be slightly see-through to other color bras, my Tango II was invisible, even with the pretty embroidery.  So it is highly recommended lingerie, at least by this new Panache fan.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I bought this bra a couple weeks after I started breastfeeding, once I could get a good read on my post-engorgement size.  The sizing was pretty confusing, but through another person\\'s review, I was able to correctly id the size I needed.  The bra fits well--it\\'s snug enough to provide some support, but not too tight.  It has stretched out some, so don\\'t order up a size!  It is not SUPER supportive, so I really only wear it when I\\'m around the house or just lounging.  It wears like a sports bra, without much lift and separation, so it doesn\\'t look great under \"nice\" clothes, but again, I only wear it around the house and with lounging clothes.  The breastfeeding hooks are nice and tight--I don\\'t worry that they\\'ll come unhooked.  Overall, it\\'s a good product.  I have a couple other Bravado nursing bras, because they are the only brand that really has my size, and I have not been disappointed by any of their products.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I like this bra a lot. It is a nice light fabric bra that is comfortable but still lends support.  The cups flap all the way down when you unsnap them so they aren't hitting your baby in the face like the foam cups do. The snap for the cup is easy to maneuver with one hand. I can sleep in it comfortably.  There are a few things I dislike but none of them are bad enough to really skew my review. It doesn't clasp in the back but rather pulls over like a sports bra. I just don't like that. I'd rather have it be like a regular bra. Because of the sports bra like back (racerback) it also shows under some tops. There are seams down the cups which are kind of bulky and uncomfortable but I don't notice them much because I always wear nursing pads.  There is only a thin piece of elastic to hold the bra  strap when the cup is open which is nice because it doesn't get in the way like the wide band does on some nursing bras, but it seems like it is way too long. Also, the sizing of these bras is really confusing. But i still love the bras! Despite all the sorta negatives, it performs well enough merit 4 stars easily.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This is the first sports bra I\\'ve bought that wasn\\'t one of those one-piece, uniboob-creating deals you find in sports apparel outlets.  It\\'s such an improvement over struggling into/out of one of those, I was tempted to give it 5 stars on that alone.  It\\'s not especially stretchy, so it\\'s pretty firm where it should be firm and holds you in place.  To me, that\\'s a plus.I love that it has actual cups and center gore.  One of my top complaints about one piece, standard sports bras was that I always had an uncomfortable trickle of sweat between my boobs during workouts, and it looked relatively obscene to try to wipe it in any way.  This has eliminated that problem.It also fits much better than a typical S/M/L size does, and as a result I don\\'t have extreme irritated red lines anywhere.  Any good, supportive bra is going to make a little bit of impression on your skin, but what I experienced between this bra and the other type is night and day.I felt supported, but I have less than a D cup and I don\\'t do much high impact exercise, so I might not be the best person to evaluate maximum support needs.  It kept me from bouncing on the elliptical, the treadmill, and that weird machine that\\'s a cross between a stair stepper and an elliptical.  Sometimes I actually have felt bouncy on those in other bras, so there is some improvement in that department.Some other reviewers complained about it feeling wet after they sweat in it, but as far as I understand, all fabrics feel wet when saturated with liquids.  Felt no different to me than when I delayed taking off my old \"sweat wicking technology\" bras, which would just feel cold and mildly squishy if not removed quickly.  Who\\'s marinating in their workout bra for hours after they\\'re done?  Gross, dudes.Lastly, the distinct lack of uniboob is nice.  The cups are full enough not to give me underarm cleavage, which nobody ever wants even if you\\'re not trying to look like a haute couture model in the gym or on the track.I don\\'t have the experience to compare it to similar styles in any other brand or material, but this is a better and affordable alternative to your average cupless sports bra.  I only have one concern:  I am short (5\\'1\") and have pretty small shoulders by any standards, but these straps felt a teeny bit snug even on the longest strap placement.  I\\'m not sure if this would fit as well on a taller person.  It would not surprise me to hear that other people found the straps too short/too tight, even though I found them comfortable enough and adjusted to the feel after wearing it for a bit.  Still, nowhere NEAR as tight as a one piece uniboober.  Also, I can see how some people might feel the band runs small or snug.  It doesn\\'t have nearly as much stretch as you may be used to in a bra, so be cautious while ordering.  Measure yourself for sure.',\n",

In fact, the way the bra is designed, there is an extra piece of fabric on the sides that gives your chest a very flattering, shapely look.  Also, the shoulder straps are perfectly spaced unlike some bras that fall down your shoulders and you're forever hiking them back up.The highest quality straps and fasteners of any bra I own.  Does not loose support over time. Washes well.I now have one of these in every color.  What I love about this bra is it's supportive enough for a workout yet comfortable enough for everyday wear. In fact, it's the most comfortable bra I own.  I have 7 different brands of sports bras and all manner of regular dress-for-the-office bras, when all my bras are clean and I have the pick of the litter, this is the one I grab.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Natori bras are notoriously wider than regular bras. I've tried their Cool Contour bra; the only size that was close to my fit (32G) confirmed this issue. This is why I sized down to their 32DDD for this sports bra. It supports from the band but does not lay completely flat in the front center. If you are in-between sizes like me, know that this will not be an absolutely perfect fit. I love the adjustable straps though.This is also a great bra for low-impact exercise. It definitely minimizes side-to-side bounce. However, for high-impact, I have to layer it with a compression bra to ensure minimization of up-and-down. This could be partly because it is a cotton material with soft cups (no padding or contouring). Also, cotton is not the best for major sweat-sessions; so keep that in mind.I ordered this one for the low price. It does encase the breast tissue; but it does not look as pretty as some other sport bras for women with bigger cup sizes (e.g. my breast shape is round/full on top, but this bra make me look fuller on bottom). If you need to supplement your exercise wardrobe NOW and have a big cup size, this is a decent bra for the activities I listed above. Otherwise, save your money for Wacoal or Freya Sport bras (and get a proper fitting).\",\n",

When it was time to replace the current crop, I went to my normal bra store, only to discover they were out of it in my size.  On a whim, I checked on Amazon.  They not only had the bra, in my size, but at a cheaper price.  What's not to love?This is a great bra for larger busted women.  It really keeps the girls in place.  And unlike most bras, it doesn't seem to stretch out.  Maybe that's because I don't put them in the dryer.  It also helps that the straps are not elastic.

I loved the black color and the covered toe bed comes up nicely for added protection.  The fit was still a bit snug on the width (but getting better as I keep wearing them) and a bit difficult to insert my foot due to my high instep.  Length wise it was perfect in ordering one size up.They are comfortable for trail walking although a bit of a pain to take on and off if a pebble gets into the shoe from the side openings.  Love the covered toe beds and the shoe is comfortable on the bottom of my foot with just enough arch support but not so much that it bothers or hurts my flat arch.The disappointment comes in that they are slippery on wet boulders, wet tiles, and muddy trails.

So much that I bought the shoes (very good), bought the work boots (steel toed also very good), bought the socks (not so good).I don\\'t honestly wear the H2 sandals that much, maybe had them about a year (bought them last late summer/fall), but live in the northeast so its mostly a summer shoe, 4 -5 months a year or so.  So we went to Grand Tetons, these were my \"off hiking day\" shoes for the trip.  We did a 6 mile flat hike and the backs ripped out of one of them. By the way the socks have holes in the sides (not heals or toes like you might expect).  Used to be all their products seemed to have 5 star ratings... me thinks the expansion to all kinds of shoes may be causing some kind of performance issues.So not much use, the treads on the bottom frankly look brand new but the heels ripped.  I dunno if I will get another Keen shoe, I am seeing some of their newer stuff has some bad ratings.  Still I\\'d take them over almost anything Teva, but not at full price. I guess I would take another shot for $50 or $60... but for $100 they need to last more than a season.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I have been wearing these for the past five years. Years ago on a family vacation at a lake with a rocky shoreline, I sliced my toe open on a rock. After that I tried various water shoes and sandals over the years, none of which I really liked. Then one day at the beach I saw a friend wearing these, and he bought me a grey pair for my birthday. I have worn nothing else since.I recently bought a second pair in black, not because the first pair had worn out (they still work just fine), but because I wanted a different color, and think the black pair look really sharp. Here is why I like these.1. This is the most heavy duty pair of sandals that I have owned. While some reviews have noted that they are heavier than other sandals (which is true), to me that does not affect their comfort in any way, or the ability to walk or run in them (I like running on the beach with these because I don't have to worry if they get wet).2. These provide the best protection for your feet that I know of. No worries about stubbing your toe because the toe is reinforced like no other sandal or water shoe that I have owned. It's like having the protection of a work boot.One review notes that sand can collect in the toe area and other parts of the sandal when you walk on the beach. True, but it is not uncomfortable, and I just rinse these off when I leave the beach for the day.3. The bottom also provides solid reinforcement. No worries for me about cutting my feet on broken shells at the beach or slippery rocks at the lake. These have also protected my feet from sharp coral reef and jagged volcanic rocks that I have encountered on vacation. These sandals literally saved me from serious personal injury when a jet ski I was riding on vacation flipped over in an area filled with volcanic rocks--I felt them on the bottom of these sandals as I tried to right the jet ski. Without these sandals my feet would have been sliced to ribbons.4. The traction on these is excellent. I have used these to go into the deep end of an empty in ground pool that is coated with slimy algae to clean the walls without losing my balance. I have also used them to climb on jettys at the beach.5. I wear a medium width and recommend that you size up either a half size or full size. My first pair were a full size up and a little loose. My current pair is a half size up and fits perfectly. But each person's feet are different.Bottom line: I wear these for any water related activity that I do--sailing, power boating, jet skiing, walking on the beach, going in the ocean, even swimming in a lake that has a rocky bottom (it is a little tough to swim with them, but I prefer that to slicing my feet on a rock). I highly recommend them.Shop for price. During the summer you can often find them on sale for 15-20% off. I bought mine online on sale from EMS.\",\n",

I don't know about the rest of you gals, but I don't want to plop down $100+ for a vinyl bag. My old purse was half cloth, half vinyl and fell apart at the straps. I had purchased a Kipling bag for my daughter at the mall. I thought it was expensive, but considering the quality and how it compared to the other bags, it wasn't too bad. Of course, I found the bags much cheaper online. Anyway, I love this purse. It holds everything and is just the right size. I keep the strap short. I like the fact that it is washable. The only downside to it is the phone compartment in the front. It's made to fit the older style phones. My smart phone is too wide for it. Also, shortly after my purchase the price dropped by $10. Sure wish Amazon would give a store credit for that.\",\n",

About three or four years ago I purchased this satchel from the Montgomeryville Army-Navy store in Montgomery Twp., PA. Priced at a mere $8.99, I grabbed it up right away. This bag is actually a lot more useful than one may give it credit for. I bought it in olive green and removed the shoulder strap, sliced two small holes in the upper rear portion, and sewed in two small olive green loops to blend in with the original material. I then attached it to my rear bicycle rack to be used as a first aid kit. I adorned it with the proper Red Cross emblem and Cadaceus. I liked it so much, I went back and bought another one and likewise did the exact same thing.Sadly to say with other reviewers is that their bag did in fact break, however, (I, usually in question would like to know just what the devil did the user put in it in order for it to break)? Generally, if an individual is wise, they will see the size and dimensions, and the general assumed weight capacity. In other words, don't put a laptop or a bowling ball inside unless you wish for the satchel to collapse on you.I personally recommend the olive drab color, (that is if you're a military enthusiast or historian like myself), but, that of course is just me. The bag is indeed constructed well, the thick canvas supports everyday, necessary items, books, snacks, binoculars or other interesting gear of small size. The rear board inside is thick cardboard and cannot be broken. I did learn from the army-navy store I bought mine from is that some bags are actually constructed with particle board believe it or not.Overall score:  (A+)\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Alright, the first thing you need to be aware of when buying Dickies clothes is this: Their sizes are true-to-measurement. That is, if you put a measuring tape around your \"waist\" (wherever you wear your trousers), and look at that number, that\\'s the measurement you want to buy your trousers in. I used to buy trousers at Old Navy, where they size things way differently. Their size 38 is actually closer to a 40 or 41 (maybe even 42). Not so with Dickies.  So when you buy Dickies trousers, you may have to estimate upward a bit, or better yet, just put a tape measure around wherever you wear your pants, just to be sure.Okay, now that that\\'s out of the way, the trousers themselves are great, but you\\'re going to want to wash them once before wearing them for an extended period of time. They arrive in a very tight and stiff state, a little scratchy and rough. So just wash them once and they\\'ll be much more comfortable to wear. They\\'re sturdy, comfortable, nicer than traditional dickies work trousers in that their fit is a bit more modern and loosely cut. They actually sit at my hips, rather than at my waist (which is how I prefer to wear my trousers.They\\'re really solid, basic trousers, and if you look around a little you can find them in some cool colors, including some pretty wacky colors. I recommend them highly if you\\'re a guy who wants something other than jeans that can pass for \"office\" wear but are still comfortable and durable.',\n",

I have been wearing the men\\'s twill work pants now for months and enjoy them a lot.  So, I decided to try out their jeans.  Very nice indeed.  BUT...where are the other two loops?  The last pairs of jeans I bought were from Lands End and they were great.  Very comfy and 7 loops on them, as they should have.  So, when I went looking for Carhartt jeans, I looked at reviews and photos very carefully before buying, and what I saw was encouraging.  The photos for the jeans I chose all had 7 belt loops so I thought this would be exactly what I was looking for...um...nope.  When they arrived, they only had 5, more like cheaper brands that don\\'t have as much \"attention to detail\" as the better ones.  I was so used to the 7 loops on my previous jeans, that 5 just doesn\\'t \"feel\" right?  Does that make sense?  I decided to keep them, and to be honest, they are comfy and durable and very nice to wear, they look good too!  But, I wish I had the 7 vs. 5 loops.  It may be a \"small\" thing in the grand scheme of things, but it bothers me that their product description doesn\\'t mention number of belt loops, but the photos all show 7 loops, but that isn\\'t what you get.  But, again, I am happy with them and will continue to wear them.  And the price point was great.  Half of what I spent on the Lands End jeans.  So, if you can live with 5 belt loops, their GREAT!

I was skeptical to buy them, given they are very expensive for a single pair of briefs - however they are by far worth it. I\\'ve been buying about one pair every month or so and replacing everything else I own with them. I have recommended them to three different people - and convinced them to use them exclusively as well. They do not hold odor in, so if you wear them for a couple days, work out in them, or whatever - they will not stink.I wear them as my dailies, but they\\'ve replaced my other special purpose briefs. Like working out - I like them a lot better then my other compression boxer briefs. While they don\\'t \"compress\" as much obviously - they seem to wick moisture a lot better then any other boxer briefs I\\'ve had, and generally feel more comfortable when working out. I also wear them backpacking when I\\'m out in the wilderness for a week or so at a time and don\\'t lug around extra change of clothes on my back. They wash up well in a little bit of water, and dry within a few hours. I\\'d definitely recommend anyone looking for a luxury pair of boxers, and has never felt comfort in their shorts before, to try these.',\n",

I bought 2 of these and 2 of the sports briefs from another store about 4 months ago and I whenever I wear them I always comment to myself that they are the best underwear I have ever worn. Whether you are a brief wearer or not, it will be hard to deny that these are not comfortable and functional. I just ordered 2 more of these and four more Sports Briefs so that I can start wearing these more everyday.Waistband: The waistband appears to be made of elastic. So far they have held up after several washes as if they are new. When I wash them I always allow them to air dry so that may be part of why they are holding up so well. The band flexes with you. I\\'m 5\\'11\" and 195 lbs and I don\\'t feel it cutting into my stomach which is a plus.Material: I swear this is the best combination of material. Its soft to the touch and flexible enough to allow you to not feel constricted while still offering the support needed if you want to transfer from sitting at a desk to running a few miles.General Feeling: These are a little more spacious than the briefs but fit about exactly the same with just the longer leg. I did feel the seat kind of start to meld together which felt like it started to get a hole but I was able to pull it apart fine.They are cooling and dry quickly in the heat and it appears that they can be rather warm and snuggly in the cold. I cannot recommend this product any more than I already have. The only drawback is the cost. Amazon provides a good deal on these but if they were ever to dip under 10 bucks I would replace most of my underwear drawer.',\n",

Spending an entire day working outside in the summer AZ sun can be brutal, but these boxers did a better job of keeping the moisture away than any cotton boxers would have.  There were times while traveling that I also tested the &#34;wash and wear&#34; theory, washing them at the end of the day and hanging them to dry for the next day.  Worked very well.  Using a towel to gently wring out excess moisture, these dried overnight and worked great the next day.  The few times I ended up having to wear the same pair for multiple days, they still did a great job of keeping me dry without smelling too foul.  After many positive experiences with my first pair, I ended up buying four pair total.I also wear these daily to work as well as out working on the property.  Having retired from the military, I now work in an office that requires business casual.  The flat seams and smooth fit make them extremely comfortable under slacks.All in all, it is really hard find a better pair of moisture wicking underwear.  I can highly recommend these if you don't need a flame retardant capability.\",\n",

The case is very solid, yet not too thick, which was a complaint I had with many of the inexpensive digital and diving type watches.  The face is very easy to read in all light conditions, including dark with the glowing hands and illuminator when needed.  As written in previous reviews, you can hear the watch tick,, but only in extremely silent conditions, or when you hold it close to your ear.  I actually find this feature to be pretty cool, reminds me of sitting in a silent room in school with the clock on the wall ticking during a test.  The strap is comfortable, and not bulky, but may be the weak point--- I'd expect the watch to far outlast the strap, which could be replaced.  Overall a great value for a good looking watch that features a simple classic design.  Much closer to a fine 1000$ watch than the 35$ price-tag would indicate.\",\n",

The higher end expedition watches are very heavy but very durable, mine just broke from a fall of 5 feet to concrete, still functions but broke off the wheel for time setting. This watch to me is a outdoor woman's field watch, as not all of us like he tiny, dainty watches that these companies make for us wild women. Reasonable size very basic functions, time & date and glow light. And a decent band for once. I would really like to find a women's style, ( not too butch not too pretty) true outdoor watch with some added functions like gps or compass that don't look quite so yucky as some of the guys watches. I actually like some of the aviator watches and others but yes they only come in jumbo wrist sizes. Some company will one day figure it out and make a killing selling fashionable functioning outdoor gear for women, still waiting. This watch only gets 4 stars, as durability is still suspect. I'm very active and my watches take a beating, so will see. The greyish face takes getting use to and the light comes off as a greenish color. Just weird colors to put together- grey, green, brown two tone band and silver case, color blind are you?? Guess it will be wet and muddy soon anyway....\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I love Under Armour sweatpants. The look is pretty stylish, especially considering sweatpants are typically not considered as such. The outside is somewhat  shiny/smooth, not like your everyday sweats. There is no elastic band on the bottoms, so they hang loose and dug hug your ankles. The inside is fleece, so I personally wouldn't use these to workout in, as I feel it'd be too hot. But that's just my preference. I generally wear them when it's too cold for shorts and I'm too lazy to wear jeans.One word of advice: Don't be a dope and run them through the dryer! Clearly not paying attention, I threw two pairs of these into the dryer after washing them. Result: Two pairs of medium men's sweatpants now fit for a small child. Looks like I'll be buying a few new pair come fall...\",\n",

I\\'ve seen similar generic/no-name cargo pants sitting on the racks of places like Ross, Marshall\\'s, etc., for far less that were made far better than these.  The fabric is thin and the \"vintage\" aspect is simply another way of telling you that these have been washed with pumice stone (I found a couple in the pockets of the ones I received), which only add to the general feeling of how low-quality the fabric is.  If it was low-quality to begin with, in this case, washing it with pumice stones does nothing to help it and only showcases how low-quality and non-durable the pant is.Returned mine.',\n",

I have bought many earrings like these over the years, and these were the same as those I bought (for gifts). I knew they would be smaller and more dainty than the picture showed. And they were exactly as expected. The reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is that they were not boxed. They were simply put in a pouch and sent to me. These are sold by Silver Insanity and these earrings should have been in a nice little box. This was NOT a classy move on their part. Otherwise, they are exactly as expected, including the light blue topaz stone. If you like flashy, big earrings with thicker silver, then these won't make you happy.

I kept trying to attach my old watch to the main, nylon-webbing portion of the watchband, not realizing that there's a little elastic portion that is properly sized to fit your watch onto. So I swore and raged and hated this watchband for about an hour, then put it down and forgot it for a day or two. Then I looked at some reviews of it here and -- lo and behold -- someone mentioned the elastic part that the watch affixes to. THIS IS CRITICAL FOR GETTING YOUR WATCH ONTO THE BAND.Okay, now on to the band itself. It's comfortable and easier to clean/sanitize than the leather band I was using. The leather band started to smell really sour after about a year or so. When this one started to get a little stinky (after about a month or two), I just dunked it into some rubbing alcohol and presto change-o, it didn't stink anymore. I sweat a lot onto my watch, so the option of cleaning the band properly without damaging it is really important to me.Also, this band molds to fit the size you set it at.  Not permanently, mind you, but it will return to the size you set it for, after a few days of setting it at that size.  In that respect, it's like a leather band.  It doesn't yank the hairs out of your arm like a metal band, and if it ever wore out, I wouldn't feel bad about replacing it cause it was so inexpensive. Also, the little bit of flexibility that the watch has on the elastic holder makes it less likely to snap off or break if I catch it on a backpack strap or anything like that.I'm not saying THIS band in particular is the one you should get. But this class of bands? Perfect solution to a very pragmatic guy like myself. You're not going to turn heads with your fashion sense, but you will have a reliable, comfortable, utilitarian watch band.\",\n",

The clasp is the end of the band which goes through a plastic loop and fastens to itself with velcro.  Actually my only complaint is that I\\'m a big guy and the strap, even at its most loose, is a bit tight for me.  I know - lose weight!  So, my overall rating is good, but for me, not great.',\n",

Incredibly uncomfortable until you wash them several dozen times or wear them in. If you wear them for the first time and it's hot outside, they are stuffy, itchy and you sweat like a pig in them.2.) A button really needs to be what holds the pants closed, not a clip. When you kneel down to do something, it pops open, which allows the zipper to come undone. Not cool.3.) Waist rides too high and is so tight that if you tuck in a Dickies shirt (which some places require) you won't be able to close the pants.

The first day I wore them I safety pinned 2 inches off the bottom and they still scraped the ground when I walked.  I will have to hem these somehow, but at least the pants were too long (and fixable) instead of too short (essentially useless).  Also the pants are kinda thin and they dont seem like they will last, but we shall see.  I like that they arent too thick so they can breath, but im skeptical of getting more than a year or two of use out of them.All in all, they are very comfortable and the pockets and stitching seem secure enough.  If they were more true to their size I would give a 5 outta 5, but due to the additional hem work that will be needed, they lose a star.  I would buy these again, but remember they run big.

I got the biggest size in this and I wasn't able to fill it completely because it was so big and it got a very small hole in it on my first trip using it. I think it's probably because it was so huge and not completely full that it may have got caught in something. I would recommend getting the middle size (the largest size is really HUGE) for regular travel. If you plan on stuffing it with bedding then the huge size would probably be ok. I would definitely recommend this product. Reasonably priced and sturdy army duffle. The challenge is filling it up!\",\n",

Because these shorts are made of a 50/50 poly-cotton jersey knit, I ordered them a size larger than I normally wear--medium--thinking that even though they initially might be a bit big, they would shrink enough to be a good fit on me. Unfortunately, the medium was far too small for me.  In fact, I'd guess that the medium would be a perfect fit for someone who normally wears a small.  I have reordered the shorts in a large because they are nicely made and exactly what I need.  My only complaint is that the sizing seems very inaccurate.  They definitely run about a size smaller than other knit shorts in the same size.\",\n",

I have owned coldgear in the past and has good results, felt warm in cooler without ever getting overheated. However, the ones I used to have didn\\'t keep me warm when it got below say 45 degrees or so. I needed a new pair, so bought this \"Frosty\" pair that supposedly would keep me even warmer than my last pair.Not so. These don\\'t keep me particularly warm. They are thinner than my other pair, and I feel like the wind cuts right through them. Granted, I don\\'t jog anymore due to a neck/back injury, but I fast walk, which in my experience, warms me up as fast and as well as jogging ever did. It was only 55 degrees out this morning, but humid here in the Seattle area. Maybe it was the humidity, it was kind of \"misty\" out. Someone from Seattle or a cool and humid place like it might know what I mean, it was cloudy, not raining, but the air had definate moisture in it that gets your clothes damp and condenses a little on your skin. Not sure if that matters, but I felt a damp chill as the light wind hit me. I was shivering within minutes and did not get warm thereafter. Like I said, I do get cold easily, but I feel since these are rating for colder temperatures than I am usually out in here in Seattle, I feel like they should have kept me much warmer than they did. They are very thin, not as thick as my last pair, and I felt not thick enough to block wind at all.The fit was better than my last pair though. I don\\'t have thin ankles. I have big achilles tendons from year sof playing soccer (so I\\'m told) and finding boots or hiking boots is a challange, because everything is too tight in the ankles. My last pair of coldgear tights were WAAAY too tight in the ankles, so much so that I had to pulled them down over my feet or I got deep red marks on my ankles and stuff started to go to sleep down there! The ankle elstic on these in tight enough to keep the tights in place but not so tight as to be at all uncomfortable. Another thing, though, while putting them on, and I did not pull hard at all, the seams on the legs and hips popped when the fabric stretched even the tiniest bit. I can\\'t see any split seems or anything, but i can\\'t imagin from the amouth and feel that there aren\\'t broken stitches just waiting to come apart. I stopped and intead of pulling from higher up on the calf, i first pulled the elastic over my foot, them sort of scrunched the legs up, but still I kept hearing those popping noises from the seems, and when I got to the hips, I had to pull to get them up the rest of the way, and winced at more popping. They were long enough for my 33.5\" legs, which I like. My last pair was too short, and since I had to pull the ankled down over my foot, they kept falling down, so that aspect was a plus.One other thing. I don\\'t really care about compression, so that wasn\\'t a consideration when purchasing, but in case it matters to some others, I felt zero compression in these tights, and i was careful to order the correct size.Overall, the fit is comfortable, and the length was great, but I just didn\\'t feel like these tights were sturdy or warm. I need a wind breaker on top I think to make them warm enough, and I think there\\'s a good possibility I\\'ll need a sewing machine at some point.',\n",

When I received these, I loved them, but they are not tight enough to be considered compression tights at all.  I kept them rather than returning, because they are still useful for cold weather running, and they are very comfortable, well-made and otherwise very nice.  I also did not have a problem with the ankle elastic as some other reviewers mentioned.  I'm writing this review in case there are other people trying to decide about which size to get- I wish I had gotten them a bit smaller.  If you're between sizes, size down!\",\n",

They are not super loose, but they are not like my other compression tights.  A size larger than I normally wear and they are like regular sports tights.Second, I would definitely recommend layering them under sweatpants or warm ups if your temps hover at around 0F.  They are warm, but not super warm for that weather.  I'm sure once Spring comes, they'll be fine for running and staying warm in temps around freezing.I appreciate the extra elastic around the ankle.  They don't hike up and they keep the cold air from coming in at my ankles.The only addition I would make is to add a small pocket.  My other compression tights, from another company, have a zippered pocket at the back which is perfect for a house key.\",\n",

I'm a woman who wears men's T-shirts in order to get more room in the shoulders and a longer length. I usually don't have a problem with fit, until I bought these in colors.The athletic heather fit fine and washed and held up well but the colors fit differently - cut slimmer. The colors also shrink much more than athletic heather. Colors also lost pigment in blotchy patches. Not sure why since I never use bleach in any part of my laundry.The reason athletic heather acts differently (does not loose color, fits differently, does not shrink) is the ahtletic heather is made of less cotton content.I do not recommend the colored tees.I DO recommend athletic heather.If I could I'd give the colors all a 2 star rating and the athletic heather a 5 star rating.PS) I would consider these to be summer weight. They are not very heavy or thick. Athletic heather seems a little thinner than colors due to less cotton content.\",\n",

With the adjustment things removed they work just fine for me. I would say order a 34x34 or 34x32 but then they are going to be a bit long and it might not add any extra strap length. So tall lean muscular guys or gals? Be repaired to do some minor modifications. I bought these as a joke, since I am from Alabama and everyone out west thinks this is what everyone back home wears. Now I am in love though and I wear them often.',\n",

I mean, after all, why buy designer overalls? So when I got home from work and tried them on I was very pleased that the fit was perfect and the material, clasps, buttons and so on are all really good quality. I can see these lasting me a good many years and as soon as they are done tumble drying I'm going to wear them out to our favorite cajun restaurant tonight for some crawfish and gumbo. They will look great with a long sleeved jersey, then a  long sleeved 3-button thermal Henley over that and of course my white Converse Chuck Taylor Hi-Tops!

The toast was too dark, better for those with a caramel or darker skin tone. The b was also kind of tight on the waist. The light toast was too light. the toast though is closer to my complexion and since this is for my Wonder Woman (Linda carter style) costume, it will work. The c fit quite comfortably too.

I will post again with how they hold up.  But for this price, I can pick up a few pairs for the price of one pair of Uggs.  Worth the try, for sure.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"So here's the deal...these have got to be the best boots ever.  I have heel spurs so I have to be careful about what I put on my feet.  Although, as expected, they hurt after a while, all I have to do is my leg stretches and all is right with the world again.  These boots are comfortable, warm, cozy, fuzzy, you name it.  I forgot I had them on at one point during a 16hr shift.  They feel like walking on a furry floor.  That's as best I can describe them.  I wear Birkenstock for the most part and AVIA because of the spurs.  These boots fit great and with the extra leg stretches, feel great too.  Trust me.  I've gone through many shoes/boots to find what works for me, spending ridiculous amounts of money to do it and been sorely disappointed in the process over the years.  I'm taking them to get fitted for an orthotic as soon as the holidays are over.  Remember what I said earlier, it's NOT THE BOOT that hurts, it's my feet that are messed up.  For the person without bad feet, you'll quickly fall in love with these boots.  I'm wearing them already without the orthotic and I LOVE THESE BOOTS!!!  Both of my feet have spurs but only the right one reminds me in these boots.  Usually BOTH feet will feel as though someone is stabbing me with a serated edged knife in any shoe/boot except Birkenstock and AVIA after about an hour.  I had these boots on for about 6 hrs before the right foot started to scream.  Even then, the pain was so minimal, I kept waiting for the REAL pain to hit...got up, did my stretches for about 30 seconds and POOF, the pain was gone.  The left one never did hurt nor was it uncomfortable.  I wore two pairs of sweatsocks with the boots just in case they didn't live up to what others have posted about them being warm.  I catch the bus.  I live in Michigan.  By the time I got to work, I took one pair of socks off.  No problem.  Wore them home in colder temps.  No problem.  Thank a bunch BEARPAW rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.\",\n",

These are my second pair of bearpaw abigails and I like them so much I may get another.The only thing a bit strange worth mentioning is that I ordered these in a size 8, and they fit very much like the same style with a knitted upper in size 7's that I have. That other pair were a tad snug in the 7's, but they stretched out after a few wears and are good now.  I opted to get these in an 8 as I didn't think the sheepskin upper would be as apt to stretch.  Well, oddly enough these fit just a smidge roomier than the knitted abigails i have but they feel very much the same. They do not feel a full size bigger. It worked out fine for me but I wonder if this pair are mis-marked or if the sizing difference has to do with the style of the boot.... because I recently returned a pair of emma tall boots by bearpaw in a size 8 (I didn't like the look of them as much) and those also fit me in 8's but were considerably more roomy than these. That pair would have been good for wearing big thick socks whereas these are too tight on the upper to wear thick socks.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I read the reviews and saw tons about the seam inside being uncomfortable in the back.  I had bought a pair of these about 3 years back and there was no such problem then and they were sooo soft, so decided to try anyway.  Unfortunately it\\'s true.  The way they\\'ve stitched the ending of the seam together center inside back on the top, it\\'s too thick and sticks out about 1/8\" inch, and it\\'s NOT soft.  If they wouldn\\'t have pulled the waist band so tight to stitch, it wouldn\\'t be a problem, but alas it is.  However, because these tights are soooo soft and durable, my daughter wanted to keep them anyway, and I found a simple fix... a bandaid.  Just stick it over that seam that sticks out and voila, no more issues so she can wear the tights for all the perks, without the problem....  I\\'m sure it could be fixed further maybe by cutting that extra area off and having it stitched together, with less excess, but sewing is unfortunately not my forte.  In comparison though, the regular Bloch tights we used to buy, seem to have gotten cheaper in quality though because they used to last years, and now they\\'ve ripped within 3 uses....  so just one of those things that makes it hard to decide which way to go.

So I purchased some more Gold Toe to replace them. Bah! Can't believe these things have the Gold Toe label. They wear and feel like your basic Hanes or FoTL. No density. No exceptional construction. Just your generic, thin sock. I'm so tired of things being made so cheaply. I don't mind paying more for quality, but it's like none exists anymore. Even the more expensive items are cheaply made...with your extra money going towards the brand alone. For me, Gold Toe socks are no longer a quality item worth investing in.\",\n",

Out of the package they didn't feel very cozy, but now that I've worn them I see that they are. An excellent product.Update: It's now many months later and I'm still a fan of these socks. I never wear out clothing, but I have a long history of wearing out socks --however, these socks show no sign of wear. Something else I like about them is the way they come out of the washing machine: still white and bright. I go around in my stocking feet whenever I'm in the house, and don't hesitate to wear the socks outside when I need to pick up the mail or water a plant. Other socks I've owned never looked clean after being washed because of all that I put them through -- but these socks launder beautifully every time. All these months later, they still look new.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Gold Toe Men's Windsor Wool Over the Calf Dress SockI've been wearing these socks for 20 years, of course different pairs over the years, as they do eventually wear out.  Depending on how you wash and wear them, you can get a little over a years worth of wear from the socks. What I found interesting is when they do wear out it's not in the foot area, it's in the calf area.  They develop holes in the interlocking weave as the thread wears thin and breaks down.  This happens from the ankle to the top of the sock just below the band which keeps the socks from falling down.Now, as to being comfortable, they are very comfortable, and they do wick perspiration away from the foot area.  So your feet remain dry, even on hot days.  It's important to have a good pair of shoes for foot support and these socks will help in the support of the calf and ankle.  These, over the calf socks, remain in place and you do not have to keep pulling them up as with other brands of socks.I have a size 13 foot and I find that getting the sock over the foot to be a bit of a struggle, but once you get the sock over the foot to the heal pulling them up to the knee is easy.  The ribbing in the weave of the sock can be straighten out for a well-finished look.  I like the over the calf look because they do NOT show flesh when you cross your legs.  These socks give a finished look to your slacks.You may get a bit of restriction from the band at the top of the sock, just below the knee, especially if you wear them for long periods of time, you stand a lot during your work day or if you experience swelling of the feet and lower legs.  If you experience the latter, I would consult with your physician.  These socks do give a mild support but are not designed as a true support hose.All in all, I'm satisfied with the quality, wearability, and life of these socks.  Any other socks wouldn't last as long as these.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I\\'ve been wearing gold toes as long as I can remember. They have always held up well, looked great and are reasonably priced. I\\'ve read some reviews that they have changed the quality of the sock recently. I have to agree, yes, these are different then some older pairs I have laying around. However, I don\\'t feel these are inferior to the older versions. It seems there is less cotton in the new versions which at first concerned me, however after extended use I have noticed that they retain their shape much longer then before. I have yet to find a \"quitter\" (sock that no longer stays up). Also there is less beading/pilling (those little fuzzy pills that appear on wear spots) then the older models. Because of this I feel these socks will look better and last longer then the older models. However, that being said I do miss the breathability of having more cotton and the slight increase in comfort. But for the price you really cant beat gold toe socks.',\n",

I ordered the small despite my aversion to ordering anything in small; I normally have a 29-30 inch waist. Their sizing was true to form, I can't currently fit it around my 8 months pregnant tummy at all, so thats a good sign. The overall height seems appropriate, not too tall or too short. Its a little tough to put on by yourself; but that could be because I tried it on my husband and he is bigger than the recommended belt size.I am satisfied with this purchase and I think it will work out well to help reduce my waist size postpartum.I think this is a great accessory for mothers and everyone should get one for their postpartum months to help get back to their original shapes.\",\n",
