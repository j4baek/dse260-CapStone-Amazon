    "\n",
    "In many ways, recommender systems were a catalyst for the current popularity of machine learning.  One of Amazon's earliest successes was the \"Customers who bought this, also bought...\" feature, while the million dollar Netflix Prize spurred research, raised public awareness, and inspired numerous other data science competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems can utilize a multitude of data sources and ML algorithms, and most combine various unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning techniques into a holistic framework.  However, the core component is almost always a model which which predicts a user's rating (or purchase) for a certain item based on that user's historical ratings of similar items as well as the behavior of other similar users.  The minimal required dataset for this is a history of user item ratings.  In our case, we'll use 1 to 5 star ratings from over 2M Amazon customers on over 160K digital videos.  More details on this dataset can be found at its [AWS Public Datasets page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix factorization has been the cornerstone of most user-item prediction models.  This method starts with the large, sparse, user-item ratings in a single matrix, where users index the rows, and items index the columns.  It then seeks to find two lower-dimensional, dense matrices which, when multiplied together, preserve the information and relationships in the larger matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://data-artisans.com/img/blog/factorization.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix factorization has been extended and genarlized with deep learning and embeddings.  These techniques allows us to introduce non-linearities for enhanced performance and flexibility.  This notebook will fit a neural network-based model to generate recommendations for the Amazon video dataset.  It will start by exploring our data in the notebook and even training a model on a sample of the data.  Later we'll expand to the full dataset and fit our model using a SageMaker managed training cluster.  We'll then deploy to an endpoint and check our method.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "_This notebook was created and tested on an ml.p2.xlarge notebook instance._\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by specifying:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The S3 bucket and prefix that you want to use for training and model data.  This should be within the same region as the Notebook Instance, training, and hosting.\n",
    "- The IAM role arn used to give training and hosting access to your data. See the documentation for how to create these.  Note, if more than one role is required for notebook instances, training, and/or hosting, please replace the `get_execution_role()` call with the appropriate full IAM role arn string(s)."
